### Hi there! Irina is here.

#### https://irinamsvch.github.io/irinamsvch/

I'm on a new career path to Front-end development. I have a huge love for the field and enormous desire to continuously broaden my knowledge. 

‚ùó I'm currently looking for a remote job.

- I have knowledge in  JS, HTML, CSS, Git, Webpack, GitHub Pages and learning Vue.js.

- I'm a minimalist and a rationalist and my desire to write a beautiful but understandable code.

- I love new places thus walking around (a lot), traveling, and living in different cities, countries and continents. 

- Please feel free to contact me by email: irina.moysevich@gmail.com.
