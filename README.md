### Hi there! Irina is here ðŸ‘‹

I'm on a new career path to Front-end development. I have a huge love for the field and enormous desire to continuously broaden my knowledge. 

- I'm currently looking for a remote job.

- I have knowledge in  JS, HTML, CSS, Git, Webpack, GitHub Pages and learning React.

- I'm a minimalist and a rationalist and I desire to write a beautiful but understandable code.

- I love new places thus walking around (a lot), travelling, and living in different cities, countries and continents. 

- Please feel free to contact me by email: irina.moysevich@gmail.com.
